# Broiled Salmon with Lemon and Dill

## Ingredients

- 1 salmon fillet (6-8oz per person)
- 1 lemon (sliced)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1-2 tablespoons fresh dill (or 1 teaspoon dried dill)
- Kosher salt (to taste)
- Freshly ground black pepper (to taste)

## Recipe

### Prep

- Defrost salmon in refrigerator overnight, or place in a bowl with cold water for 2 hours (change water every 30min)
- Preheat oven to 525°F on broil setting
- Rinse salmon under cold water and pat completely dry with paper towels
- Place salmon skin-side down in a glass baking dish or on a foil-lined baking sheet

### Season

- Drizzle olive oil over both sides of salmon
- Season both sides generously with salt and pepper
- Sprinkle dill over the top of salmon
- Place lemon slices on top and around the salmon
- Fold salmon as necessary so all parts cook evenly

### Broil

- Position oven rack on the top shelf (4-6 inches from broiler)
- Broil for 7-8min for medium doneness (internal temp 125-130°F)
- Salmon should be opaque and flake easily with a fork
- For well-done, broil for 9-10min (internal temp 145°F)

### Alternative: Bake

- Position rack in the middle
- Preheat to bake 475°F
- Bake for 9min

### Serve

- Remove from oven and let rest for 2-3min
- Garnish with fresh lemon wedges and additional dill if desired
- Serve immediately

## Tips

- Don't overcook - salmon continues cooking after removed from oven
- Look for the white albumin protein to appear on surface as a doneness indicator
- For crispier skin, start skin-side up for 3min, then flip
- Leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days

## Doneness Guide (Internal Temp)

- Medium-Rare: 120-125°F (translucent center, recommended)
- Medium: 125-130°F (slightly translucent center)
- Medium-Well: 130-140°F (opaque throughout)
- Well Done: 145°F (USDA recommended, fully opaque)
