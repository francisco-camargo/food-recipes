# Scallops

## Ingredients

- 1 lb large sea scallops (about 12-16 scallops)
- 2-3 tbsp high smoke point oil (avocado, grapeseed, or vegetable oil)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tbsp butter (optional, for finishing)
- Lemon wedges (for serving)

## Recipe

- Rinse with water
- Pat scallops completely dry with paper towels (moisture prevents browning)
- Remove side muscle if still attached
- Season both sides generously with salt and pepper
- Add 5mm layer of oil to a large skillet or cast iron pan
- Heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering (but not smoking)
- Carefully place scallops in pan with space between each (don't crowd)
- Cook undisturbed for 2-3 minutes until a golden-brown crust forms
- Flip scallops and cook for another 2-3 minutes until opaque in center
- Optional: add butter to pan in last 30 seconds and baste scallops
- Remove from heat immediately to avoid overcooking
- Serve with lemon wedges

## Tips

- Scallops should reach an internal temperature of 130-135°F
- They should be opaque but still slightly translucent in the very center
- Don't move them while cooking - this prevents a good sear
- Work in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan
