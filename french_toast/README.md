# French Toast

## Ingredients

- Two slices of bread
- Tablespoon of milk
- 1 egg
- Pinch of salt
- Vegetable oil (eg canola oil)

## Recipe

- Mix egg, milk and salt in a flat bowl
- Heat vegetable oil in a pan at medium heat
- Put bread in bowl to soak up egg mix well

Depending on the bread you will have to vary how long to cook the bread. Seedelicious bread can take about a minute until egg white is not visible. White fluffy bread is done very fast, otherwise it gets soggy in the inside
